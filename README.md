# High-Concurrency Flash Sale API

> An optimized backend system designed to handle thousands of concurrent checkout requests with 100% data consistency. Built to solve the classic "Negative Stock" race condition during Flash Sale events.

## The Architecture & Core Solution
In a standard CRUD setup, 50 to 1,000 users attempting to buy an item with a limited stock at the exact same millisecond will result in data anomalies, typically leading to a negative stock balance (Race Condition).

To prevent this without introducing heavy message brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ, this API implements:
*   **Pessimistic Locking (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`):** Enforced via TypeORM's `queryRunner` to queue concurrent requests at the database engine level (PostgreSQL).
*   **ACID Transactions:** Ensuring that the stock decrement and order creation are treated as a single atomic operation.

> Note: This Throttler branch focuses on measuring the baseline latency and performance when users hit the API, with rate limiters (throttler) by nest.js without reddis caching storage, or authentication.

## Throttler Configutarion
Configure the Nest Throttler with two layers for a seconds and a minute for available request to hits, whit the minimum up to 5 request per seconds and maximum 200 per minute to prevent the DDos attacks, without reddis caching storage and auhtentication system.

### Configuration Code:
* **Throttler Moduler:**
```text
import { ThrottlerModule } from "@nestjs/throttler";

export const throttlerModule = ThrottlerModule.forRoot([{
    name: 'short',
    ttl: 1000,
    limit: 5,
}, {
    name: 'long',
    ttl: 60000,
    limit: 200,
}
]);
```

* **Throttler Guard:**
```text
import { Provider } from "@nestjs/common";
import { APP_GUARD } from "@nestjs/core";
import { ThrottlerGuard } from "@nestjs/throttler";

export const throttlerGuard: Provider<ThrottlerGuard> = {
    provide: APP_GUARD,
    useClass: ThrottlerGuard,
}
```


## Benchmark & Stress Testing (K6)
This system was stress-tested using **Grafana K6** with the following parameters:
*   **Virtual Users (Concurrent):** 220, and as much is possible in 15 secconds by 100 with different IP (~49.000) VUs.
*   **Test Duration:** 10, 15, and 120 seconds for different scenario.

### Summary of Results:
*   [x] **Zero Data Anomalies:** The database recorded exactly 100% successful orders handled by throttler for modest traffic (~220 VUs) and massive traffic (7.500 VUs) per seconds. The stock stopped exactly at 0. **No negative stock occurred.**
*   [x] **Graceful Rejection:** Excess requests were successfully rejected with a `429 Too Many Request` by throttler and `400 Bad Request` (Out of Stock) response.
*   [x] **Breaking Point Analysis:** 
    * At **~220 VUs**, the server handled the queue flawlessly, with **Throttler** configuration in short and long layer is really working in this scenario: 
        * **Short Layer:** When requests with the same IP wants to hit API at exact same seconds, short layer let 5 request by limit configuration to be processed and the rest of request has rejected by **Throttler** (rejecting request with 429 errors).
        
        * **Long Layer:** When 220 requests with the same IP wants to hit API with 300 miliseconds pause (~3 request per seconds) in total 120 seconds, short layer passed the request and the request never reach the limit of the long layer (rejecting request with 400 errors).
    
    * At the massive VUs with **~49.000** in 15 seconds, the server successfully resistance when get hit by **7.500 VUs** per seconds by 100 VUs with different IP, the database safely processing few request (75 VUs) the stock stopped exactly at 0, and the rest of request get rejecting by **Throttler**. The reason why the rest of limit on long layer (125) get rejected, because in the first seconds when 7.500 VUs hits the short layer just let in the first 5 request per IP following the system of **throttler** so in total of 100 VUs times 5 limit in short layer is become 75 and long layer is never running because the short layer is rejeceting the rest of VUs.

### K6 Metric Results:
* **220 VUs with the same IP (Stable):**
    * **Short Layer:**
