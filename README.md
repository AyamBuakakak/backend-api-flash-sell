# High-Concurrency Flash Sale API

> An optimized backend system designed to handle thousands of concurrent checkout requests with 100% data consistency. Built to solve the classic "Negative Stock" race condition during Flash Sale events.

## The Architecture & Core Solution
In a standard CRUD setup, 50 to 1,000 users attempting to buy an item with a limited stock at the exact same millisecond will result in data anomalies, typically leading to a negative stock balance (Race Condition).

To prevent this without introducing heavy message brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ, this API implements:
*   **Pessimistic Locking (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`):** Enforced via TypeORM's `queryRunner` to queue concurrent requests at the database engine level (PostgreSQL).
*   **ACID Transactions:** Ensuring that the stock decrement and order creation are treated as a single atomic operation.

> Note: This main branch focuses on measuring the baseline latency and performance when users hit the API directly, without the aid of caching, rate limiters (throttler), or authentication.

## Benchmark & Stress Testing (K6)
This system was stress-tested using **Grafana K6** with the following parameters:
*   **Virtual Users (Concurrent):** 50, 100, 500, and 1000 VUs
*   **Initial Stock:** Randomly set between 7 to 118 items
*   **Test Duration:** 10 seconds per scenario

### Summary of Results:
*   [x] **Zero Data Anomalies:** The database recorded exactly 100% successful orders for modest traffic (50 - 100 VUs). The stock stopped exactly at 0. **No negative stock occurred.**
*   [x] **Graceful Rejection:** Excess requests were successfully rejected with a `400 Bad Request` (Out of Stock) response.
*   [x] **Breaking Point Analysis:** 
    * Up to **~250 VUs**, the server handled the queue flawlessly. 
    * At **500 VUs**, the Node.js server remained active, but the database began experiencing **connection pool exhaustion** (rejecting queries with 500 errors). 
    * At **1000 VUs**, the server became overloaded and rejected 70% of the traffic (Connection Refused).

## Tech Stack
* Framework: NestJS (Node.js)
* Database: PostgreSQL
* ORM: TypeORM
* Testing: K6 (Load Testing), Vitest & Supertest (Unit & E2E Testing)

## How to Run Locally
* Clone this repository: `git clone <your-repo-url>`
* Start the database using Docker: `docker-compose up -d`
* Install dependencies: `npm install`
* Run migrations: `npm run typeorm migration:run`
* Start the server: `npm run start:dev`

## Future Improvements
*   [ ] Implement Rate-Limiting (Throttler) to handle DDoS anomalies and drop excessive requests gracefully.
*   [ ] Implement Redis Caching for product catalogs to drastically reduce read operations on PostgreSQL.
*   [ ] Build a custom Authentication System using JWT and HttpOnly Cookies on the frontend.
*   [ ] Add comprehensive e-commerce features (Order History, Order Cancellation, Product Management, etc.).
*   [ ] Separate the read and write database operations (CQRS Pattern) for horizontal scaling.
