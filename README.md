# High-Concurrency Flash Sale API

> An optimized backend system designed to handle thousands of concurrent checkout requests with 100% data consistency. Built to solve the classic "Negative Stock" race condition during Flash Sale events.

## The Architecture & Core Solution
In a standard CRUD setup, 50 to 1,000 users attempting to buy an item with a limited stock at the exact same millisecond will result in data anomalies, typically leading to a negative stock balance (Race Condition).

To prevent this without introducing heavy message brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ, this API implements:
*   **Pessimistic Locking (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`):** Enforced via TypeORM's `queryRunner` to queue concurrent requests at the database engine level (PostgreSQL).
*   **ACID Transactions:** Ensuring that the stock decrement and order creation are treated as a single atomic operation.

> Note: This Throttler-Reddis branch focus on optimizing data fetching with Redis when users hit the API, with rate limiters (throttler) by nest.js + reddis caching storage without authentication.

## Throttler Configuration
Configure the redis with docker server for available request to hits api with caching data, make a docker file contening with configuration code, and run with docker CLI.

### Docker File:
```yaml
services:
  redis-dev:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    container_name: redis_dev_server
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
  redis-commander:
    image: rediscommander/redis-commander:latest
    container_name: redis_dev_ui
    environment:
      - REDIS_HOSTS=local:redis-dev:6379
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    depends_on:
      - redis-dev
```

### Docker Command:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

## Benchmark & Stress Testing (K6)
This system was stress-tested using **Grafana K6** with the following parameters:
*   **Virtual Users (Concurrent):** 20 VUs with distinct IP injection (X-Forwarded-For).
*   **Test Duration:** 0 seconds with a 1-second staggered delay.

### Summary of Results:
*   [x] **Performance Optimization:** Implemented a robust Redis caching layer using custom NestJS Interceptors for read-heavy operations (GET endpoints). Successfully reduced response latency from ~68ms (Database Query) to < 2ms (Memory Cache Hit), achieving a ~97% performance improvement validated via k6 load testing.
*   [x] **Throttler Resilience:** 100% of legitimate staggered requests were successfully processed (Status 200) without triggering the rate-limiter block.

### K6 Metric Results:
* **20 VUs with the different IP (Stable):**

* Framework: NestJS (Node.js)
* Database: PostgreSQL
* ORM: TypeORM
* Testing: K6 (Load Testing), Vitest & Supertest (Unit & E2E Testing)

## How to Run Locally
* Clone this repository: `git clone <your-repo-url>`
* Start the database using Docker: `docker-compose up -d`
* Install dependencies: `npm install`
* Run migrations: `npm run typeorm migration:run`

## Future Improvements
*   [x] Implement Rate-Limiting (Throttler) to handle DDoS anomalies and drop excessive requests gracefully.
*   [x] Implement Redis Caching for product catalogs to drastically reduce read operations on PostgreSQL.
*   [ ] Build a custom Authentication System using JWT and HttpOnly Cookies on the frontend.
*   [ ] Add comprehensive e-commerce features (Order History, Order Cancellation, Product Management, etc.).
*   [ ] Separate the read and write database operations (CQRS Pattern) for horizontal scaling.
